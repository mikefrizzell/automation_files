# About
 These are a few Python scripts I've written to automate things on my Mac.

# Usage
To use, replace <username> with your own user name. If you want to automate the whole process, schedule the script as a (cron job)[https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/what-is-a-cron-job-and-how-do-you-use-them/] or schedule with (Lingon)[https://www.peterborgapps.com/lingon/].
